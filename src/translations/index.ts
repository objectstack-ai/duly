// its entry HERE and never edits the config. The config is the one file every
// parallel task would otherwise collide on.
//
// The collection is a named array rather than `Object.values(barrel)`: on an
// empty namespace `Object.values` has nothing to infer from and TypeScript
// resolves it against the keyed branch of `MetadataCollectionInput`, which
// makes `name` optional and fails the assignment. A named array is `never[]`
// while empty and infers correctly the moment something is pushed into it.
